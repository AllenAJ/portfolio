# Folio
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/dewanshrawat15/Folio.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dewanshrawat15/Folio)

The idea is to create a simple reusable template for everyone. People who need a personal portfolio website urgently should be able to get one without writing a single line of code. Users need to update relevant details in the ```src/conf/data.json``` file and see they're changes live.
